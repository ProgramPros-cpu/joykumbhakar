            "question": "Is Secure Folder really secure?",
            "answer": "Absolutely. Secure Folder uses AES-256 encryption, which is the gold standard in data security. Your files are encrypted before being stored and can only be accessed with your master password or biometric authentication."
        },
        {
            "question": "What happens if I forget my password?",
            "answer": "For security reasons, we don't store your password. However, during setup you can optionally set up security questions or link an email address for password recovery. Without these, you would need to reset the app, which will erase all encrypted data."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can I access my files on multiple devices?",
            "answer": "Yes, if you enable cloud backup during setup. Your encrypted files will sync across all your devices logged in with the same account. Without cloud backup, files are only stored locally on your device."
        },
        {
            "question": "Does Secure Folder work without internet?",
            "answer": "Yes, Secure Folder works completely offline. Internet is only required for optional features like cloud backup or checking for updates."
        },
        {
            "question": "How is this different from Android's built-in Secure Folder?",
            "answer": "While Samsung's Secure Folder is only available on Samsung devices, our app works on all Android devices. We also offer more customization options, better cloud integration, and additional security features like intruder detection."
